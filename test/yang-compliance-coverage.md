## Current RFC 6020 Implementation Coverage

The below table provides up-to-date information about various YANG
schema language extensions and associated support within this module.
All extensions are syntactically and lexically processed already, but
the below table provides details on the status of extensions as it
pertains to how it is **processed** by the compiler for implementing
the intended behavior of each extension.

Basically, note that the *unsupported* status below indicates it is
not compliant with expected behavior although it is properly parsed
and processed by the compiler.

Most of the *supported* extensions and typedefs have a corresponding
*test case* reference link which will contain the associated mocha
test suite which contains the validation tests.
